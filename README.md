- Error page customization
- Shalow navigation
- Architecture patterns for internationalization and localization in JavaScript
- Implement i18n in React.js
- Handling large amounts of data
- Avoid unnecessary renderings

# Features

- Integrate the Contentful CMS API into Next.js
- Good optimization practices for static sites
- Using Graphql and its code generator
- Image optimization with Next.js and Contentful CMS
- User language detection and redirect based on language
- Use throttling and debouncing
- Revalidation cache to improve load times

# Running the app

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBarcenas/nextjs-plantpedia.git
cd nextjs-plantpedia
# if you use npm
npm install
# if you use yarn
yarn install
```

## Development
`next dev` starts the application in development mode with active code reloading, bug reports, and more.

The application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default.


## Build
`next build` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output shows information about each route.

## Run the application in production mode
`next start` starts the application in production mode. The application must first be compiled with: `next build`

# Notes

Don't forget to set your environment variables. In the project there is a file called **.env.local.example** there it has all the variables you will need.\
It will also be necessary that you have an account created in [Contentful CMS.](https://www.contentful.com/)
